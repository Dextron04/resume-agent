    "title": "Text_To_Speech",
    "summary": "**Project Overview:**\nA Python-based Text-to-Speech application that converts written text into spoken words using a graphical user interface. This lightweight solution offers an accessible way to transform text input into audio output, making it particularly useful for accessibility purposes and content consumption.\n\n**Key Features:**\n* Simple and intuitive graphical user interface built with Tkinter\n* Real-time text-to-speech conversion using pyttsx3 engine\n* Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)\n* Easy-to-use interface requiring minimal setup\n* Support for default system voice models\n\n**Technologies Used:**\n- Python\n- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech engine)\n- Tkinter (GUI framework)\n- System voice libraries\n\n**Impact & Benefits:**\nThis project provides an accessible solution for users who need text-to-speech capabilities, particularly beneficial for individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities. Its simple interface and straightforward implementation make it an excellent tool for both educational purposes and practical applications in content accessibility.\n\nNote: While the portfolio summary above focuses on the project's strengths, it's worth noting that the creator acknowledges limitations in the default voice model and plans future improvements. The project's simplicity and ease of use make it a solid foundation for further development and enhancement.",
