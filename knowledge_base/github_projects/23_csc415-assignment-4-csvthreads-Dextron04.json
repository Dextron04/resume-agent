    "summary": "**Project Overview:**\nA multi-threaded CSV data processing system designed to analyze law enforcement call data. The project efficiently parses large CSV files and generates statistical summaries of emergency response times across different districts and neighborhoods, demonstrating advanced threading capabilities and data processing optimization.\n\n**Key Features:**\n* Custom CSV parser handling complex field formats including quoted text and embedded newlines\n* Multi-threaded data processing with configurable thread count for performance optimization\n* Real-time statistical analysis of emergency response metrics and dispatch times\n* Thread-safe data structure for concurrent access and updates\n* Detailed performance timing analysis across different thread configurations\n\n**Technologies Used:**\nC, POSIX Threads (pthreads), Make, CSV Processing, Linux System Programming\n\n**Impact & Benefits:**\nThis system enables efficient analysis of large-scale emergency response data, helping identify patterns in response times across different districts. The multi-threaded approach significantly reduces processing time for large datasets, making it valuable for real-time emergency response analysis and resource allocation planning.\n\nThe portfolio summary emphasizes the technical complexity and practical applications while highlighting the project's focus on performance optimization and concurrent programming. The description maintains a professional tone while clearly communicating the project's value and technical achievements.",
