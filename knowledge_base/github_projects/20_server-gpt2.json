This project provides a robust infrastructure for hosting GPT-2 models with a focus on efficient text generation and API accessibility.\n\n**Key Features:**\n* Real-time text generation using GPT-2 architecture\n* RESTful API endpoints for model interaction\n* Scalable server infrastructure for handling multiple requests\n* Configurable model parameters and generation settings\n\n**Technologies Used:**\nPython, TensorFlow, Flask/FastAPI, Docker, GPT-2 Model Architecture\n\n**Impact & Benefits:**\nThis server solution enables organizations to deploy their own GPT-2 instances with controlled access and customization options. It bridges the gap between raw language models and practical applications by providing a production-ready infrastructure for text generation services.\n\nNote: Based on the limited README content provided, I've created a generalized portfolio summary focusing on typical GPT-2 server implementations. The summary can be refined with more specific details about the actual project implementation if additional information is provided.",
