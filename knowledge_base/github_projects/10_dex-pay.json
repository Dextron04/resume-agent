    "title": "dex-pay",
    "summary": "**Project Overview:**\nDex Pay is a comprehensive educational fintech platform that replicates India's UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system from the ground up. This project serves as both a learning tool and reference implementation, demonstrating how modern digital payment systems work while providing a foundation for future global remittance solutions.\n\n**Key Features:**\n* Complete UPI system simulation with mock banking infrastructure\n* Real-time payment processing with instant notifications\n* Virtual Payment Address (VPA) creation and management\n* QR code generation and scanning for payments\n* Multi-bank account integration with secure authentication\n\n**Technologies Used:**\n- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion\n- Backend: PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs\n- UI Components: Radix UI, React Hook Form\n- Development: PNPM, ESLint, Vercel deployment\n\n**Impact & Benefits:**\nThis project bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation of modern payment systems. It serves as an invaluable educational resource for developers looking to understand fintech architecture while providing a foundation for building real-world payment solutions. The platform's design as a learning tool makes complex payment systems accessible to developers worldwide.\n\nThe project demonstrates professional-grade development practices while maintaining its educational focus, making it an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing full-stack fintech development capabilities. Its modular architecture and comprehensive documentation make it an ideal reference for understanding how successful payment systems like UPI are built and operated.",
