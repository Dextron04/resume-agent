    "summary": "**Project Overview:**\nA robust API Gateway solution that serves as a secure middleware layer between clients and backend services. This enterprise-grade system implements essential API management features including rate limiting, OAuth 2.0 authentication, load balancing, and Redis caching to deliver optimal performance and security for high-traffic applications.\n\n**Key Features:**\n* Advanced rate limiting with Express Rate Limiter to prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage\n* OAuth 2.0 authentication system with JWT support for secure API access control\n* Intelligent load balancing using Caddy to distribute traffic efficiently across backend services\n* High-performance Redis caching that reduces API latency by up to 40%\n* Real-time monitoring and logging capabilities for system health tracking\n\n**Technologies Used:**\nNode.js/Express.js, OAuth 2.0, Redis, Caddy, Express Rate Limiter, JWT, API Gateway\n\n**Impact & Benefits:**\nThis API Gateway solution significantly enhances API security and performance while reducing backend service load. By implementing intelligent caching and rate limiting, it achieves a 40% reduction in API response times and provides robust protection against DDoS attacks and API abuse, making it ideal for enterprise applications requiring high availability and security.\n\nThe portfolio summary focuses on the most impressive technical aspects while maintaining a professional tone. I've highlighted the quantifiable improvements (40% latency reduction) and emphasized the enterprise-ready nature of the solution. The format is clean and easily scannable, making it effective for both technical and non-technical audiences.",
